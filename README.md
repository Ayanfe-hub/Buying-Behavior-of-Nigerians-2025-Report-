This repository contains a complete analytical project investigating the buying behavior of Nigerians in 2025, using primary data collected through a Google Form survey. The project covers data acquisition, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, visualization, and insight generation.

## 🟢 Project Overview
In November 2025, a consumer behavior survey was conducted to understand the shopping patterns, spending habits, preferred payment methods, and decision drivers among Nigerians. A total of *107 respondents* participated.

The analysis provides actionable insights into how Nigerians spend, where they shop, and what influences their decisions.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze demographic distribution of respondents  
- Understand shopping frequency and spending behavior  
- Identify top shopping platforms  
- Determine payment method preferences  
- Explore factors that influence buying decisions  
- Visualize findings in an Excel dashboard  
- Provide recommendations for businesses targeting Nigerian consumers

## 🧩 Data Collection
Data was collected through a structured Google Form with 10 questions covering:
- Gender  
- Age range  
- Location  
- Monthly shopping frequency  
- Average Monthly Spending 
- Shopping platforms  
- Preferred Payment methods  
- Buying Decision Influences
- Categories of Products Bought frequently

Raw responses were exported to Excel and prepared for analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

## ⚙️ Process Workflow

### 1. *Data Acquisition*
Google Form → Excel export → Uploaded raw data to Microsoft Excel

### 2. *Data Cleaning*
- Removed empty rows  
- Standardized text format  
- Extracted numerical values where needed  

### 3. *Feature Engineering*
- Computed a column named "Active Shopper" categorizing respondents to "Frequent" (users that shops more 5 times  monthly) and "Occassional" (less than 5 times)
- Calculated another column named "Monthly Spend Category" depending on average amount respondents spends on shopping monthly i.e. High, Medium and Low

### 4. *Analysis*
Performed using Excel Pivot Tables:
- Distribution analysis  
- Trend and pattern identification  
- Cross-tab relationships (eg. income vs payment method)

### 5. *Dashboard Development*
A dynamic Excel dashboard visualizing:
- KPIs  
- Demographics  
- Spending and frequency  
- Platform ranking
